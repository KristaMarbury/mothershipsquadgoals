# Description

This browser application allows a user to select a superhero depending on a characteristic, ie: strength, inteligence, or speed.

Upon accessing the web application, the user is taken to a login screen. If they are a first time user, they can click the link underneath the login form to sign up. 

Once they have successfully signed in they can view their chosen hero, chose a new one, or battle a randomly generated hero. 

Battles take place on the battle page and once there, users can pit their superhero against  one another to see who will win. The fighting is turn based and is generated quickly. If the user's hero wins, they will recieve a point that will be saved and can be viewed on the teampage. 

# Setup/Installation Requirements
